Hello, I'm Alex Antonison. I am a Data Engineer with over a decade of experience across Government, Healthcare, and Environmental Science. One consistent focus has been to evaluate the process of data in an organization and identify opportunities to streamline data processing, management, and analytics. Once a process is mapped out, I work with stakeholders to identify solutions ensuring high quality data is timely, accessible, and easy to use.
