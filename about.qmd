I am an ex-Healthcare Data Engineer that has transitioned to working in Environmental Science. My approach is to take common techniques used in managing and processing Healthcare data to help streamline data in the Environmental Science space. I do this by building use-case specific data platforms that make Environmental Science data accessible and easy to use.

I currently work both for the Data Science Institute at MTSU (https://www.mtsu.edu/datascience/index.php) as well as my own business (https://www.antonison-cg.com/).
