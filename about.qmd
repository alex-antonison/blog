A Data Engineer with 10 years of experience building data platforms that has transitioned to working in Environmental Science. My approach is to take common techniques used for processing and managing data in Healthcare and apply them to Environmental Science. I accomplish this by building use-case specific data platforms that make Environmental Science data accessible and easy to use.

I currently work with the [Data Science Institute at MTSU](https://www.mtsu.edu/datascience/index.php) and I have my own consulting business, [Antonison Consulting Group](https://www.antonison-cg.com/).
